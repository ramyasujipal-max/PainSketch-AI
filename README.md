# PainSketch-AI

PainSketch-AI is a PyTorch-based deep learning model that interprets hand-drawn sketches on a body diagram to detect and localize pain areas. Built for **Fusion Hacks 2**, this project aims to help doctors communicate with patients who can't speak or understand the local language.

## 🧠 Problem Addressed

Many patients struggle to describe pain due to language barriers or medical conditions. PainSketch-AI allows users to simply **draw where it hurts**, and the model identifies the affected region to aid diagnosis.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users draw pain locations on a digital body diagram.
2. Sketches are preprocessed and fed into a CNN/LSTM model in PyTorch.
3. The model outputs the predicted pain region.
